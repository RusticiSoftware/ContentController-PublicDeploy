# This is an example inventory file.  If you're setting up servers once and deployment to them every time,
# you can use the inventory file to avoid needing to specify every server at the command line.
#
# To use, copy this file with a new name (such as inventory.prod or inventory.stg), then when running your
# playbooks, add it from the command line:
#    ansible-playbook -i inventory.prod ....
#
