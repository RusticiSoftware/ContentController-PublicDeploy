# Content Controller Self-Hosting Documentation

Documentation is generated by gitbook. You need to have node.js installed. Install the rest of the dependencies with:

    npm install

When editing the documentation markdown files you can run a local server instance with live reloading by running:

    ./test

To build a static website copy which can be used for a release run:

    ./generate

This will create a 'documentation' folder with the generated html files including the dispatch documentation. You will need the (Calibre)[https://calibre-ebook.com/] tool installed when doing the generation so that the PDF version is output. (Note for Mac OS X: the command line tools are inside the calibre bundle, for example, if you installed calibre in /Applications the command line tools are in /Applications/calibre.app/Contents/console.app/Contents/MacOS/ which needs to be in the `PATH`.)

To publish the static copy run:

    ./publish
