# CloudFront

Cloudfront acts like a reverse proxy in front of your Content Controller Server and the S3 bucket that you use for storing course content. For most connections, it just passes the request to your web tier. For requests for course content, CloudFront authenticates the user via a signed cookie that the application generates, and if the user is allowed, it serves up the content from your S3 bucket.

To get started, you need to have completed _at least_ the [Certificate Manager](/self-hosting/aws/certificate-manager), [S3](/self-hosting/aws/s3), and [Load Balancer and Target Group](/self-hosting/aws/load-balancer) steps in the [Deploying in AWS](/self-hosting/aws/aws) section before this one, and it will be easiest if you have completed _all_ of the steps.

## Signing Keys

We use signed cookies to authenticate requests for content that lives in S3.  In order to make this work, youâ€™ll need to generate a pair of signing keys and make them available to the application.

* [Generate your signing keys per this AWS doc](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-trusted-signers.html) and note the Access Key ID for the keypair.
* Convert the private key to DER format so that Java can read it:
```
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in pk-********************.pem  -inform PEM -out pk-********************.der  -outform DER
```

## Ansible Config

* Connect to your Ansible server and go to the `ContentController-PublicDeploy` folder.
* Run `mkdir -p roles/cloudfront/files` to create the files folder, if it doesn't already exist.
* Place the `pk-********************.der` and `public-********************.pem` files (generated above) in the `roles/cloudfront/files` folder.
* Edit the `group_vars/cloudfront.yml` file and make these changes.
  * Make sure that `use_cloudfront` is set to `true`.
  * Set your **Access Key ID** (created above) for the `cloudfront_access_key_id` variable.
  * Add the filename (without the path) for your key files similar to this:
    ```
    cloudfront_private_key: pk-********************.der
    cloudfront_public_key: public-********************.pem
    ```

## Create your Distribution

Go to **Services** -> **CloudFront**

### Create a Distribution for Content Controller

1. Select the **Distributions** tab on the left, and click the blue **Create Distribution** button.
2. For **Origin**, enter these values:
  * Origin domain: `cc-load-balancer-*****` (choose the load balancer you created earlier)
  * Origin Path: leave it blank
  * Origin name: should be auto-filled when you select your load balancer above
  * Minimum origin SSL Protocol: **TLSv1.2**
  * Origin Protocol Policy: **HTTPS Only***
  * Origin Response Timeout: 60
  * Origin Keep-alive Timeout: 5
  * HTTP Port: 80
  * HTTPS Port: 443

4. For **Default Cache Behavior**, enter the following values:
  * Compress Objects Automatically: **No**
  * Viewer Protocol Policy: **Redirect HTTP to HTTPS**
  * Allowed HTTP Methods: **GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE**
  * Restrict Viewer Access: **No**
  * Smooth streaming: **No**
  * Enable real-time logs: **No**
  * Cache key and origin requests: **Cache policy and origin request policy**, create a cache policy using the following screenshot as a guide:
  <br><br>{{< img src="/self-hosting/aws/img/cf-create-cache-policy.png" >}}<br>
4. For **Settings**, enter the following values:
  * Price Class: (Choose what you'd like here - we use **Use only North America and Europe**)
  * AWS WAF Web ACL: **None**
  * Alternate Domain Names: Enter your cc domain name here (example: `demo.contentcontroller.net`)
  * SSL Certificate: **Custom SSL Certificate**, and then choose the [certificate you created earlier](/self-hosting/aws/certificate-manager)
  * Legacy clients support: **Only Clients that Support Server Name Indication**
  * Security Policy: Choose **TLSv1** or the **TLSv1.2_2021** if you prefer security over browser support.  For more details see this AWS documentation on [Supported Protocols and Ciphers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/secure-connections-supported-viewer-protocols-ciphers.html).
  * Supported HTTP Versions: **HTTP/2**
  * Default Root Object: blank
  * Logging: **On**
  * Bucket for Logs: Choose the bucket created in the [S3](/self-hosting/aws/s3) config earlier with the suffix `-logs` (example: `rustici-demo-cc-content-logs.s3.amazonaws.com`)
  * Log Prefix: `cloudfront`
  * Cookie Logging: **Off**
  * Enable IPv6: **Off**
  <br><br>{{< img src="/self-hosting/aws/img/cf-final-settings.png" >}}
6. Click **Create Distribution**.

### Create an S3 Origin

1. On the **CloudFront Distributions** page, click the ID of the distribution you just created.
2. Click on the **Origins** tab, and click the blue **Create Origin** button.
3. For **Origin Settings**, enter these values
  * Origin Domain Name: Choose the bucket created in the [S3](/self-hosting/aws/s3) config earlier with the suffix `-content` (example: `rustici-demo-cc-content.s3.amazonaws.com`)
  * Origin Path: leave blank
  * Name: should be auto-filled when you select the S3 bucket above
  * Origin access control: **Yes**
  * Origin Access Identity: **Use an Existing Identity**, then choose the OAI you created earlier in the [S3](/self-hosting/aws/s3) step
  * Grant Read Permissions on Bucket: **Yes, Update Bucket Policy**
4. Click **Create**.

### Create S3 Origin Behavior

1. On the **CloudFront Distributions** page, click the ID of the distribution you just created.
2. Click on the **Behaviors** tab, and click the blue **Create Behavior** button.
3. For **Settings**, enter these values
  * Path Pattern: `/courses/*`
  * Origin: Choose your S3 origin you created above (example: `S3-rustici-demo-cc-content`)
  * Compress Objects Automatically: **No**
  * Viewer Protocol Policy: **HTTPS Only**
  * Allowed HTTP Methods: **GET, HEAD, OPTIONS**
  * Cached HTTP Methods: leave unchecked
  * Restrict viewer access: **Yes**
  * Smooth Streaming: **No**
  * Cache key and origin requests: **Cache policy and origin request policy**, create a cache policy using the following screenshot as a guide:
  <br><br>{{< img src="/self-hosting/aws/img/cf-behavior-cache-policy.png" >}}<br>

4. Click **Create**.

### Add CloudFront to Route 53

You'll want to be able to access Content Controller through your own CNAME instead of using the URL for the CloudFront endpoint.  To allow that, we'll use Route53.

Go to **Services** -> **Route 53**

1. Click on **Hosted zones** on the left sidebar.
2. Click on your Public hosted zone created earlier in the [Route 53](/self-hosting/aws/route-53) step. (example: `demo.contentcontroller.net`)
3. Click **Create Record Set**.
4. In the **Create Record Set** sidebar, enter the following values
  * Name: Enter the subdomain you wish to host CC on (example: `cc`)
  * Record type: **CNAME**
  * Alias: **Disabled**
  * Value: should be your CloudFront distribution created above
5. Click **Create**.
