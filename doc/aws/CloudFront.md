# CloudFront

Cloudfront acts like a reverse proxy in front of your Content Controller Server and the S3 bucket that you use for storing course content. For most connections, it just passes the request to your web tier. For requests for course content, CloudFront authenticates the user via a signed cookie that the application generates, and if the user is allowed, it serves up the content from your S3 bucket.

To get started, you need to have completed _at least_ the [Certificate Manager](CertificateManager.md), [S3](S3.md), and [Load Balancer and Target Group](LoadBalancer.md) steps in the [Deploying in AWS](AWS.md) section before this one, and it will be easiest if you have completed _all_ of the steps.

## Signing Keys

We use signed cookies to authenticate requests for content that lives in S3.  In order to make this work, youâ€™ll need to generate a pair of signing keys and make them available to the application.

* [Generate your signing keys per this AWS doc](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-trusted-signers.html) and note the Access Key ID for the keypair.
* Convert the private key to DER format so that Java can read it:
```
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in pk-********************.pem  -inform PEM -out pk-********************.der  -outform DER
```

## Ansible Config

* Connect to your Ansible server and go to the `ContentController-PublicDeploy` folder.
* Run `mkdir -p roles/cloudfront/files` to create the files folder, if it doesn't already exist.
* Place the `pk-********************.der` and `rsa-********************.pem` files (generated above) in the `roles/cloudfront/files` folder.
* Edit the `group_vars/cloudfront.yml` file and make these changes.
  * Make sure that `use_cloudfront` is set to `true`.
  * Set your **Access Key ID** (created above) for the `cloudfront_access_key_id` variable.
  * Add the filename (without the path) for your key files similar to this:
    ```
    cloudfront_private_key: pk-********************.der
    cloudfront_public_key: rsa-********************.pem
    ```

### Add CloudFront to Route 53

You'll want to be able to access Content Controller through your own CNAME instead of using the URL for the CloudFront endpoint.  To allow that, we'll use Route53.

Go to **Services** -> **Route 53**

1. Click on **Hosted zones** on the left sidebar.
2. Click on your Public hosted zone created earlier in the [Route 53](Route53.md) step. (example: `demo.contentcontroller.net`)
3. Click **Create Record Set**.
4. In the **Create Record Set** sidebar, enter the following values
  * Name: Enter the subdomain you wish to host CC on (example: `cc`)
  * Type: **A - IPv4 address**
  * Alias: **Yes**
  * Alias Target: Choose your CloudFront distribution created above
5. Click **Create**.
